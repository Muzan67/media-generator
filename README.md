# 7. Interactive Front-End Project
Our group used everything we’ve learned over the past six weeks to create a real-world front-end application that we will be able to showcase to potential employers. The requirements for this project are to use the skills and technologies we’ve learned over the past six weeks (deployment, interactivity, client-side storage, responsive design, polished UI).

The lessons and Challenge assignments have reinforced the importance of quality coding standards and best practices for repositories and READMEs. Use these skills to create a professional and impressive application that you could present with pride to any potential employer.
